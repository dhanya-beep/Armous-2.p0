    "clean_text": "When most people think about the quintessential student experience, they may conjure up images of late night parties, early morning lectures and spending time in the student union bar between classes. But many are struggling to balance budgeting for student fees, rent and groceries. In Belfast, in the past year, Queen's University Students' Union (QUBSU) has seen a 20% rise in students using The Pantry, a free refill station allowing students to stock up on everything from household items to fresh fruit and vegetables. \"It is unbelievable the amount of students that use The Pantry, we have over 200 students visiting every day,\" Amy Smith said. The QUBSU president, Smith said food bank runs five days a week, and the university helps to fund it. Figures from the university show there were more than 10,500 visits by students to the food bank between September and December 2025, compared to 8,691 during the same period the year before. \"A lot of our students would struggle to eat and have meals, and have three meals a day let alone one so it's really something for our students to not have to choose between heating or eating,\" Smith said. \"A lot of this comes from students not having enough money within loans, rent prices are increasing a lot and I think that's very much a contributing factor.\" \"Maybe 10 or 15 years ago a students' union would just be a place that people went on nights out, had a fun time, but now we're in a situation where students' unions have had to step up to the plate,\" said Ben Friel. Friel, the National Union of Students NI president, said the increased food bank use showed how student life and students' unions had changed. \"Students aren't just here for a night out, students get degrees, they come and contribute to the economy,\" Friel added. \"Fundamentally we need to rethink how we look at students as a whole.\" Final year student Lucy O'Rawe said a lot of the modern student experience has become \"so much more centred around how can I financially manage this?\". \"Everything goes up in price and everything gets smaller as well and lower quality, and you're paying more for something that's worse and smaller,\" she said. \"So many students are working so hard to support themselves, and I think that needs to be really respected and acknowledged. \"It's not the same anymore.\" The students' union, once a space made for students to relax in between lectures and tutorials, has now become a lifeline for some, O'Rawe added. \"If you spoke to someone over five, maybe 10 or 15 years ago and you said: 'The students' union in Queen's has a food bank for students,' they'd be shocked because that's not something you'd expect in a relatively well off part of the world.\" \"It's become a lot more common. It's so sad that it has to be normalised.\" While many may think of students using their spare change on nights out and take outs, final year law student Holly Dougan said that isn't the case. \"Students have an image and we have a reputation that's associated with going out and having a bit of fun,\" she said. \"I would definitely say it's a massive misconception.\" She said for many students, the food bank has become \"essential\" for tackling high costs. \"You just find that everything seems inflated, nothing seems to be going down or even staying the same. \"But rent would be the main one for me.\" Dougan, who also chairs the university's women's students association added the refill facility is \"fabulous\", but it's \"unfortunate that people feel that they have to go to something like that in order to have the essentials for the week\". \"It is shocking and as much as I'm ever so grateful that it's here, we do mostly associate the students' union with a bit of fun, a bit of craic, having a coffee or a drink with your friends,\" she said. \"But any time that I've walked past The Pantry, the queues have been massive.\"",
