    "clean_text": "\"We used to eat out twice a month,\" says Marjan, who lives in Iran's second largest city, Isfahan. \"Now we just can't. We have to save that money to pay the rent.\" For the last six years, she had been selling wooden crafts and keyrings through a page on Instagram - one of hundreds of thousands of Iranian women making a living that way. When the government imposed an internet blackout in early January as part of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests, these women suddenly found themselves with no income. \"Even once the internet came back, things just weren't the same,\" says Marjan - whose name, as with the other contributors, has been changed for safety reasons. \"Our sales used to be 300 million rials (around $185 on the open market) per month. Now it's not even 30 million rials.\" She and her husband are seriously considering selling their car to pay back their loans and keep up with the rent.  \"If things carry on like this, I'll probably have to look for a new job,\" she says. \"The problem is that pretty much every line of work is struggling at the moment, so even that is not a realistic plan B.\" The protests began as a reaction to the spiralling cost of living and soon focused on the whole regime, whose policies people blamed for their difficulties.  The economic situation has worsened in the weeks since the protests erupted. Affording the basic necessities of life is becoming an increasing struggle for many Iranians because of high inflation. \"Just two months ago, beef was 7m rials per kilo,\" says Mina, a 44-year-old mother of two in Tehran. \"But I bought some the day before yesterday for 19m rials a kilo - more than double. I bought Iranian rice in the late summer for 1.7m rials a kilo, now it's 3.8m.\" The official figures show that in the past 12 months, the price of basic necessities has increased by an average 60%, while food prices have doubled in the same period. And it is not just the last year. The cost of an average family food basket is currently eight times what it was five years ago and more than 30 times what it was in 2016. \"Inflation has basically become a monthly part of our lives now,\" says Amir, a 29-year-old English teacher in Karaj, 30km (20 miles) west of Tehran. \"Prices go up easily by 10% a month\". Back in the spring, he says, \"a hamburger cost 5m rials. It is now 12m. The numbers are just incomprehensible\". These soaring food prices is why you hear more and more Iranians talking about red meat vanishing from their tables in recent years, to be replaced by cheaper alternatives such as chicken, cheese or beans. Figures released by the Central Bank of Iran shows that annual consumption of beef and lamb per household has declined from 64kg in 2004/05 to 32kg in 2024/25. The inflation is forcing families to cut back. Mina says that her family has stopped buying branded goods and that they have not been on a foreign holiday since 2017. \"I can't afford to travel abroad at all. I checked a domestic trip yesterday, 200m rials per person. So for our family of four, that's 800m just for plane tickets. Back in 2017, a whole trip to Europe cost 200m.\" One of the main drivers of these soaring costs has been the rapid fall in the value of the rial. Since May 2018, when Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran and reinstated wide-ranging sanctions on the country, the Iranian currency has lost more than 95% of its value against the US dollar on the open market. The past year has been particularly turbulent. The rapid fall in the value of the rial sparked the protests in Tehran's bazaar in late December, which soon spread across the country. The protests were brutally suppressed by the security forces, who killed thousands of people. Since then, the rial's value has kept falling, pushing up the prices even higher. Those with fixed incomes can see how this has eroded their purchasing power. Sima, a former senior civil servant who has recently retired, says her income is now six times what it was a decade ago, but in dollars, it is worth several times less. \"In 2015, my salary of 50m rials a month was roughly worth $1,500. By 2020, it had risen to 130m rials and was worth around $520. Now my pension is about 300m and worth less than $200,\" says the 60-year-old Tehran resident. \"Ten years ago, I used to change my mobile phone every two years, sometimes even once a year,\" she says. \"I could easily afford a brand-new imported car back then. Now, we can't even upgrade to a slightly better second-hand one, let alone buy new.\" The gradual fall in living standards has been the story of the past two decades. BBC Persian analysis of the official data shows that over the past 20 years, the average annual household expenditure in real terms has fallen by a quarter in urban areas and has almost halved in rural areas. In other words, Iranians are on average much poorer than they were 20 years ago. This is despite the fact that from 1990 to mid-2000s this measure was on an upward trajectory. However, the sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear programme created a toxic combination of persistently high levels of inflation, low employment, and low or no real GDP growth, has resulted in Iranian families seeing their living standards fall.  And events of the last 12 months have severely worsened the situation. Since the 12-day war between Iran and Israel last June, during which the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities, the Iranian economy has remained in a state of suspense, and many think that it is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\" hostilities will flare up again. The resumption of talks on a new deal between Iran and the US in February, with Trump threatening military action if the Iranian government does not agree to his demands, has not helped the business sentiment much either. \"Investors are not thinking of expansion or creating jobs. They are only thinking of saving their business,\" says a spokesman for Iran's private sector. Farshid Shokrekhodaei, head of investment and financing at the Iran Chamber of Commerce told Ilna news agency that because of these conditions \"the capital is going towards investing in assets such as foreign currency and gold\", instead of investing in productive businesses. This is in addition to other crises that had been adversely affecting businesses and people. Iran is facing a serious shortage of electricity, natural gas and water, as a result of years of underinvestment in infrastructure and the government's failure to manage consumption. Every winter, factories have their gas supply cut off for days, even weeks, at a time.  In the warmer months, their electricity is cut off. People also have to endure regular blackouts at home, as well as their drinking water supply being shut off in larger cities. But all those problems are overshadowed by the \"not war, not peace\" situation - as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei put it - between Iran and the US. Many people, like Parham, a 26-year-old from Tehran, do not think that it can \"continue for much longer - not for us, nor for the US.\" \"Given that people are getting poorer and poorer, we're going to see a wave of social instability,\" he says.",
