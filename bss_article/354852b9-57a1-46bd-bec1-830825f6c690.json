    "clean_text": "Bridgerton having its first East Asian family is a \"beautiful thing\", say the newest stars of the hit Netflix show.  As part two of season four lands, actors from the sparkling regency drama tell BBC Newsbeat it's been \"so special\" to be part of the cast. \"When I saw they were casting a whole family of East Asians it was like, 'that's crazy',\" says Isabella Wei, who plays Posy Li.  \"I remember the feeling was really like: 'It's our time'.\"  The new episodes see Posy and her sister Rosamund burst on to the scene with their formidable mother, Lady Araminta Gun, depicted by Harry Potter actor Katie Leung.  Leading the fourth season's fairy tale-inspired storyline is Benedict Bridgerton, played by Luke Thompson.  The Bohemian second son has so far refused to settle down, but this all changes when he meets a masked lady in silver at a masquerade ball.  The mysterious love interest turns out not, in fact, to be his heart's desire from society, but a maid called Sophie Baek. With viewers set to find out if the pair's simmering forbidden love can conquer all, Australian actress Yerin Ha, who plays Sophie, tells Newsbeat that representing her community is all she's \"ever wanted\".  \"I've gone on a big journey to come back here and to be representing the East Asian community,\" she says.  Sydney-born Ha previously said she resonates with challenges that Sophie faces, such as feeling like an outsider.  \"I keep wanting to push the needle forward, so it's not a topic of conversation any more,\" she adds. For Katie Leung, who shot to fame as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films, returning to the screen in a lead role as part of an East Asian family is not a path she saw herself taking.  \"I definitely didn't think I would be here, Harry Potter was such a rare opportunity,\" says Katie.  \"I always just felt like I never deserved it. Whereas I feel like I deserve it now, because I've worked hard to be here.\" Bridgerton, which is based on a series of novels, has been criticised for casting diverse actors whose background differs from characters in the books. Creator Shonda Rhimes has previously said she found the complaints \"bizarre\".  For Isabella Wei, who plays Leung's on-screen daughter Posy Li, being in the show has been an \"amazing opportunity.\" \"All of us worked really hard to be here and put in the work on the show and it was just so special to be in a room with everyone who looked like you,\" says Wei.  \"You get to spend so much time together on this glamorous British regency show where you're not meant to be there, and we are, and that is such a beautiful thing.\" As each Bridgerton season focuses on a new sibling, it's Thompson's turn to carry the storyline, but the heat isn't getting to him. \"I've had the time to sort of chill out,\" Thompson jokes.  \"I didn't feel pressure because I feel like I had started building something in season one, and now we get to develop it,\" he says.  In addition to breaking barriers of representation, Bridgerton is known for its gripping storylines - and fans will be waiting with bated breath to find out what becomes of Francesca Bridgerton and Michaela Stirling's romance. In season three Francesca wed John Stirling, played by Victor Alli, and the pair looked to live out a quiet marriage.  However, after John introduces his wife Francesca to his cousin Michaela, played by Masali Baduza, a connection begins to grow between the pair. Netflix has confirmed that the pair will be involved in a romance - a twist Baduza admits came with a certain amount of pressure. \"But I am so honoured that I've been trusted to play Michaela,\" she says.  \"I think she's such an important character, not only to me, but to a lot of young queer black women and queer people in general. \"I love feeling that people are happy seeing themselves represented on screen.  \"I think that love comes in all shapes and sizes and everyone deserves to see their life reflected back to them.\" Bridgerton season four, part two, is available to stream on Netflix. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
