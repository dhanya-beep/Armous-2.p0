    "clean_text": "Frank Warren began working with Saudi Arabia for Tyson Fury v Francis Ngannou in 2023 Veteran promoter Frank Warren has confirmed he is considering legal action against Saudi Arabian-owned Sela and American company TKO. Warren has enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Turki Alalshikh and Sela in recent years, but the arrival of the Dana White-fronted Zuffa Boxing, jointly owned by Sela and TKO, has caused tension behind the scenes. Sela is a Saudi state-owned entertainment company and TKO Group Holdings is a media giant that owns the UFC and WWE. Warren alleges Sela and TKO went behind his back to form Zuffa Boxing, which he claims breaches the contracts he had already signed with the two entities. Warren's Queensberry Promotions, according to the Telegraph,, external allege as much as $1bn (Â£739m) could have been lost in potential earnings. In a statement, Sela said they were \"disappointed\" by the claims and \"reject them in their entirety\". This week it was revealed that Warren and Queensberry had sent \"letters before action\" to Sela and TKO raising the issues. \"It's just a difference of opinion over the contracts that we signed, so that will just take its course,\" Warren told BBC Sport. \"I can't make any comment on it. It is what it is and it will take its course.\" The potential legal action comes after it emerged that Warren has had limited involvement in Tyson Fury's comeback fight in April on Netflix. The fight was primarily organised by Sela and Netflix, and TKO chief Mark Shapiro claims Zuffa Boxing will be tasked with the promotional duties around the fight instead of Queensberry . Fury is signed to Queensberry and has been since he resumed his boxing career in 2018. 'Can't live in the past' - Warren on boxing's future after 45 years as promoter Dubois refuses world champion Wardley's fist bump  Taylor to retire after Dublin bout later this year White and Zuffa Boxing have made some serious waves since launching their first show in January. Conor Benn joined Zuffa from Matchroom and Eddie Hearn in a one-fight deal worth $15m, but Shapiro says Sela and Alalshikh are covering Benn's purse, not TKO. White has ridiculed Hearn for saying he was heartbroken by Benn's exit, claiming he feels he has come into boxing and is \"beating up babies\". Asked how any legal action could affect his working relationship with Sela and Alalshikh moving forward, Warren said nothing would change. \"We will do what we continue to do and that is put on great shows. [Wardley v Dubois] will be a sell-out show just like what we're doing in Dublin, in Germany and in Manchester with Moses [Itauma],\" he said. \"Boxing is not broken for us, it's well and alive. We're not babies, we get on with it.\" Conor Benn left Matchroom this month to join Zuffa Boxing in a shock move Zuffa have shown their intent by signing Benn and have also signed IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia. Opetaia fights Brandon Glanton on 8 March and Zuffa Boxing say their first Zuffa belt will be on the line, as well as Opetaia's IBF and Ring Magazine titles. Warren said Benn's move is something that \"happens in the sport\" and no promoter can expect absolute loyalty. \"I've been on the other side of it,\" Warren said. \"I'm old fashioned and I believe in loyalty.  \"I think loyalty is something that is respected and a two-way thing. Karma, whatever you want to call it, always comes back around. \"Regarding Conor, he has done really well for himself and exceeded all expectations because he hasn't won anything of great significance.\" Boxing schedule and results 2026 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",
