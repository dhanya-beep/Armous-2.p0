    "clean_text": "A woman who broke her spine when she fell from a window as she attempted to escape triple killer Valdo Calocane has told an inquiry of her anger when she was informed he could not be prosecuted due to mental health issues. Valdo Calocane broke into the woman's flat in 2020, three years before he killed Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates and injured three others in the Nottingham attacks on 13 June 2023. The woman, who required surgery to her spine, said a police officer told her Calocane could not be prosecuted at the time because of his mental health. On Thursday, the inquiry heard the same officer told her if she had not escaped, Calocane \"could have killed\" her. The Nottingham Inquiry - led by retired judge Deborah Taylor, has been hearing evidence from a number of witnesses about events leading up to the attacks. More than 100 witnesses, including police officers, NHS workers and former flatmates, are expected to give evidence to the inquiry over nine weeks.  Calocane was a student at the University of Nottingham when he experienced his first episode of psychosis in May 2020, the inquiry has heard.  On the night of 24 May, he broke into a woman's flat in Brook Court, Radford, in the city. The 22-year-old woman, who gave evidence anonymously through an Italian interpreter, said she had moved to Nottingham from Italy in January 2020 and was working as a cleaner at the time.  She told the inquiry she had returned home from work at 20:00 BST and was showering when she heard repeated knocking at the door.  \"I saw that this knocking was becoming louder and louder with kicks so I asked who it is,\" she said. \"The person replied 'it's me, open, open'. \"At first this was said quietly but then it became louder and the person on the other side asked, insisted on asking, to open the door and that's when I panicked.\" Before she could use the spyhole in the door to find out who was there, the woman said the door began to shake.  \"I could see the door was shaking, I could feel it was coming off,\" she said.  The woman said she put on her pyjamas and leaned out of the window to call for help, but she said - due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown - nobody was there.  \"I thought that someone wanted to hurt me. I didn't know what to do. I was by myself. I was alone. I felt like someone was going to hurt me. \"First, I was holding on to the window and I tried to jump when I slipped and fell on to the ground. I was scared, I was very scared,\" she said.  The woman suffered serious back injuries when she fell 10ft to 12ft, and was unable to talk or move, she said.  In her statement to the inquiry, the woman said when Calocane was brought into the courtyard of the complex by police, he tried to run towards her. \"He was looking at me with his eyes wide open and he tried to come to me but the officers had pinned him down,\" she said.  Recalling giving a statement to police in hospital, the woman said: \"I was very worried. I was angry. \"Also I thought what was going to happen with the person who had tried to attack me, how was this going to end?\" Following her surgery and subsequent discharge from hospital, the woman said she was visited by an officer, who told her Calocane could not be prosecuted.  \"They said they tried doing anything they could but because of his mental health problem - they mentioned schizophrenia - this person could not be jailed and he was therefore taken to a mental health institution. \"I was very angry, I was very upset because the damage he had caused is going to be forever, and I was so young, and I thought this was not enough. \"The psychiatric hospital was not enough but because there were no other possibilities, I accepted it,\" she said.  At the time, Calocane had not been given a formal diagnosis for his mental health issues. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia prior to carrying out his deadly attacks. The inquiry heard Calocane had attempted to force entry into another flat at the same complex - where he believed his mother was - in the early hours that day.  He was arrested at the time but released from custody back to Brook Court later the same day.  Custody notes, which were shown to the hearing, detailed Calocane's demeanour saying he had been talking about \"seeing the devil\".  No further action was taken in relation to the incident in the early hours.  In evidence, Insp Katie Eustace, of Nottinghamshire Police, admitted the incident was not \"given the attention it deserved\".  The inquiry continues.
