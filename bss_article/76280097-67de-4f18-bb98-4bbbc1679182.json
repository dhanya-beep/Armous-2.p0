    "clean_text": "It was a secret she'd been keeping for months, but it was finally out there. Nearly 10 million people had watched Rachel Duffy triumph in The Traitors, alongside Stephen Libby. But just three days later, amid a whirlwind of post show publicity, Rachel went from the \"highest of highs\" to the \"lowest of lows\" with the news her mother was dying. \"Mummy had been sick for a long time but nobody expected her to pass away and it all happened really quick,\" she said. Rachel was in Manchester when she was told her mum was gravely ill, but made it back home to Newry to say her last goodbye. Her mother had Parkinson's Disease and dementia. Throughout the TV show Rachel had spoken about her mum Anne and her hopes of being able to make lasting memories with her if she won any prize money. Now she says she is \"going to stay true to what I said on the show\". Rachel and Stephen each received about £48,000 for winning The Traitors. \"I'm going to make memories. I can't get to make them with mummy, but I'm going to make them with my family,\" added Rachel. \"I think being able to do nice things with them is an absolute blessing. \"So I think we're going to have a fun 2026.\" This year is already looking different for Rachel who, with husband Seán, has three children. She has given up her job as a communications director for a community organisation, a decision she didn't take lightly. \"I've worked for an amazing organisation for 18 years, helping people in the community. \"And I just thought, you know what, I'm just going to focus on me for right now and focus on my wee family.\" But what about the faithful - have they forgiven her and Stephen? There were 21 other contestants on the show and Rachel said there's none she \"wouldn't go for a coffee with\". \"They're genuinely really lovely people,\" she added. Some have already visited her in County Down including her fellow winning traitor. Faithfuls Amanda Collier, Judy and Roxy Wilson have also made the trip and enjoyed an active visit. Rachel said they \"had the best time ever\". \"We were sea swimming, mountain climbing. \"We had them all in Newcastle along the shore. \"It was beautiful.\" Harriet Tyce has also visited for a weekend and Rachel recently met up with Matthew Hyndman, the other contestant from Northern Ireland. Harriet, a former criminal barrister turned author, could be a good source of advice as Rachel weighs up what's next. While she's interested in working in television, her first post-show priority is a novel she said she has spent the past decade writing. \"It's a young adult contemporary fantasy book and it's called The Echo of the Embers. \"It's a first in a trilogy. Just watch this space.\" In Newry, where she lives, there were watch-parties for episodes of The Traitors as Rachel became more high-profile on the show. \"Before I won, you had people shouting out 'you big traitor',\" she said. \"Local people are hilarious. \"They were so supportive, but there's lots of slagging and good banter and then after I won, it changed - it was 'lend us a fiver' that they were shouting out the window.\" As for the infamous FBI training - or lack of it - Rachel said she'd contacted the agent who ran the one-day course she exaggerated into a four-month course on the show. \"I actually reached out to him to thank him to say that he was part of the reason why I won the show.\" The show was recorded last summer, but not broadcast until January this year. Rachel was sworn to secrecy about the series. \"The closer it got to the show starting, it became harder,\" she said. \"I'm very good with secrets. \"If you tell me something, I'll not repeat it, which is maybe one of the good things coming out of it. \"I'm a great liar, but I can also keep a secret.\"",
